      <h2>Moderna to apply today for FDA authorization for its Covid-19 vaccine</h2>
      <h4>Updated 8:00 AM ET, Mon November 30, 2020</h4>
      <h5><a href="http://lite.cnn.com/en/article/h_8a9d29406e73343797dbac1d4a23586c" target="_blank">view source</a></h5>
      <p>(CNN) - Pharmaceutical company Moderna intends to apply Monday to the US Food and Drug Administration for authorization of its Covid-19 vaccine.</p>
      <p>The company will ask the FDA to review an expanded data set showing the vaccine is 94.1% effective at preventing Covid-19 and 100% effective at preventing severe cases of the disease.</p>
      <p>"This is striking," said Dr. Paul Offit, a member of the FDA's vaccine advisory committee. "These are amazing data."</p>
      <p>Moderna's chief medical officer said he became emotional when he saw the data Saturday night.</p>
      <p>"It was the first time I allowed myself to cry," Dr. Tal Zaks said. "We have a full expectation to change the course of this pandemic."</p>
      <p>Moderna will become the second company to apply to the FDA for emergency use authorization for a coronavirus vaccine. Pfizer applied on November 20 with data showing similarly high efficacy.</p>
      <p>The FDA will meet with its advisory committee in December to review Pfizer's and Moderna's applications.</p>
      <p>The first vaccinations in the United States are expected to take place "towards the latter part of December," according to Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases.</p>
      <p>Moderna's new data</p>
      <p>On Monday, Moderna released updated efficacy data for its Phase 3 clinical trial.</p>
      <p>Starting in July, Moderna gave either its vaccine or a placebo -- a shot of saline that does nothing -- to some 30,000 people in the United States. With high rates of coronavirus throughout the country over the next following months, many of those study subjects developed Covid-19.</p>
      <p>But there was a big difference between the group that got the vaccine and the group that got the placebo.</p>
      <p>Among the approximately 15,000 people who received the vaccine, 11 developed Covid-19.</p>

      <h2>Coronavirus Is Surging: How Severe Is Your State's Outbreak?</h2>

      <p>More than 13 million people in the U.S. have had confirmed coronavirus infections and more than 250,000 have died of COVID-19. Tens of thousands of new cases are reported daily nationwide. In the graphics below, explore the trends in your state.</p>
      <p>View the data via a heat map (immediately below), curve charts, a table of state-by-state trends over four weeks, or a map of total cases and deaths.</p>
      <p>The map above shows the risk of infection in each state based on new daily cases per capita. The consortium of researchers and public health experts who developed these risk levels advises states in the red category to issue stay-home orders. They advise orange states to consider stay-home orders, along with increased testing and contact tracing. Yellow states need to keep up social distancing and mask usage, and all states should continue testing and contact tracing.</p>
      <p>To compare state outbreaks, the chart above graphs trend lines for average new daily cases and deaths against each state's totals to date. This type of visualization highlights a state's daily growth or decline relative to the overall size of its outbreak.</p>
      <p>When both new and total case and death counts grow quickly, the curves bend upward. As new cases and deaths slow, the curves level or bend down. In New York, the curve rose sharply before reaching over 170,000 total cases in April. New cases fell from about 10,000 per day in mid-April to under 900 a day most of the summer, before starting to rise in the fall.</p>
      <p>Explore the map above to see totals and per capita figures around the country for both new confirmed cases and reported deaths from COVID-19. New York was the original epicenter of the pandemic in the U.S. As of mid October, California, Florida and Texas surpass New York for total cases to date, though New York still has the highest death total.</p>

      <p>To show trends, the table below shows the change in average new cases per day in each state, week over week for the last 28 days. States marked in shades of red have growing outbreaks; those in shades of green, are declining.</p>
      <p>Methodology</p>
      <p>The graphics on this page pull from data compiled by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University from several sources, including the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; the World Health Organization; national, state and local government health departments; 1point3acres; and local media reports.</p>
      <p>The JHU team automates its data uploads and regularly checks them for anomalies. This may result in occasional data discrepancies on this page as the JHU team resolves anomalies and updates its feeds. State-by-state recovery data are unavailable at this time. There may be discrepancies between what you see here and what you see on your local health department's website. Figures shown do not include cases on cruise ships.</p>
      <p>Fluctuations in the numbers may happen as health authorities review old cases and or update their methodologies. For example, in early June, Michigan health authorities started including probable cases in its totals. This resulted in a brief spike in the state's daily numbers until the JHU team was able to reconcile the historical data. On June 25, New Jersey included 1,854 previously-unreported probable deaths in its totals, resulting in a spike in the state's daily death numbers. On Sept. 2, Massachusetts changed its methodology for counting probable cases, which lowered its overall case and death numbers. The JHU team maintains a list of such changes.</p>

      <h2>So You Traveled Over Thanksgiving. Now What?</h2>
      <h3>By Laurel Wamsley</h3>
      <h4>Monday, November 30, 2020 • 6:22 PM EST</h4>
      <h5><a href="https://text.npr.org/940190370" target="_blank">view source</a></h5>
      <p>Despite the repeated warnings of public health experts and officials, millions of people traveled for Thanksgiving.</p>
      <p>Perhaps you're one of them.</p>
      <p>So what should you do now to keep from creating the "surge upon a surge" of coronavirus cases that Dr. Anthony Fauci is warning the U.S. could soon face?</p>
      <p>"You have to assume you were exposed and you became infected"</p>
      <p>Dr. Deborah Birx, the coordinator of the White House's coronavirus task force, has this advice: Assume you picked up the virus.</p>
      <p>"If your family traveled, you have to assume you were exposed and you became infected, and you really need to get tested in the next week, and you need to avoid anyone in your family with comorbidities or are over 65," she told CBS' Face the Nation on Sunday.</p>
      <p>She recommends masking indoors if people in your household traveled or gathered with others for Thanksgiving. "If you're young and you gathered," Birx says, "you need to assume that you're infected and not go near your grandparents and aunts and others without a mask."</p>
      <p>If you're over 65 or have comorbidities and you gathered at Thanksgiving, watch out for symptoms.</p>
      <p>"If you develop any symptoms, you need be tested immediately because we know that our therapeutics work best — both our antivirals and our monoclonal antibodies — work best very early in disease," Birx says.</p>
      <p>Adm. Brett Giroir, a physician who oversees the federal government's testing response, says you need to be extra-careful as you return home — though he says you don't necessarily need to do a strict two-week quarantine.</p>
      <p>"Just remember you've had an increased risk of being exposed," he told CNN. "So you should decrease unnecessary activities for about a week. And if you can get tested in three or five days, that's also a very good idea."</p>

      <p>This is the time to be extra-careful, wear masks and avoid crowds, because of the increased risk that you might have gotten the coronavirus — and you could spread it.</p>
      <p>"There certainly can be a surge because of the travel and the mixing of people who have not been in their own little pods," he said, calling this "a risky time."</p>
      <p>What happens next depends on the precautions that people take now, Giroir said.</p>
      <p>"We're very concerned about the travel, but what we do makes a difference. It's not as if we're passive onlookers," he said. "We could really make a difference here."</p>
      <p>Birx agrees: "What happened happened. I mean, we know that people got together in Thanksgiving. The moment now is to protect those from having secondary and tertiary transmissions within the family."</p>
      <p>What do other experts say?</p>
      <p>Abraar Karan is an internal medicine doctor at the Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School.</p>
      <p>His advice is that those returning from travel but who don't have a known coronavirus exposure should quarantine for the next seven to 10 days. If they have a known exposure, they should quarantine for two weeks.</p>
      <p>Why does he recommend a quarantine for all who traveled? Because of the high levels of viral transmission around the U.S. right now, including by people who are asymptomatic.</p>
      <p>"[P]eople will be exposed to others who are infectious but not showing any symptoms. So in many cases, they won't even know that they had an exposure," he wrote by email to NPR. "Many people are saying they have no idea where they were infected."</p>
      <p>He recommends getting tested twice: ideally when you first return home and then again three to five days later.</p>
      <p>"This will notably increase the chance that you detect the virus over a longer incubation period," he says.</p>

      <p>And Karan emphasizes that it's important to do the quarantine right. "Quarantining doesn't mean walking around your house or apartment as if you're healthy. It means staying in your room and avoiding contact with other people as if you were infected. It means wearing a mask when you leave your room if you need to do that."</p>
      <p>Keep in mind that different states have different rules for returning travelers, so check to see what is required where you live. The requirements may depend on where you traveled.</p>
      <p>When will we know how much the virus spread over Thanksgiving?</p>
      <p>The incubation period for the virus is two to 14 days, and people who get the virus generally develop symptoms five to six days after exposure.</p>
      <p>"If there was a lot of spread around Thanksgiving, we'll be seeing that around a week or two or three into December and onward," Dr. Tom Frieden, former director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told NPR's Allison Aubrey.</p>
